Cyclistic Case Study: Google Data Analytics

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I have performed many real-world tasks of a junior
data analyst. In order to answer the key business questions, I followed the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share,
and act. In this case study I used Python programming language for data analysis purposes to answer the question for an organization so that they can make a data-driven decision and come up with a marketing strategy which to attract more customers based on my analysis and recommendations.
