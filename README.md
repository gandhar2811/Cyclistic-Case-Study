Cyclistic Case Study: Google Data Analytics
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I have performed many real-world tasks as a junior data analyst. In order to answer the key business questions, I followed the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. In this case study, I used various Python packages for data analysis and visualization purposes to answer the question for an organization so that they can make a data-driven decision and they will be able to come up with a marketing strategy which to attract more customers based on my insights and recommendations.
