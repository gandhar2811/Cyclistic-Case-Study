# Cyclistic-Case-Study
Cyclistic Case Study: Google Data Analytics
## Scenario:
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of
marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your
team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diƸerently. From these insights, your team
will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve
your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## About the Company:
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oƸering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One
2approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and
annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who
purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be
key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very
good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and
have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do
that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders diƸer, why casual
riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could aƸect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in
analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Objective:
Find out how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently so that these insights will be essential to design a marketing strategy aimed to convert casual riders into annual members.

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I have performed many real-world tasks as a junior data analyst. In order to answer the key business questions, I followed the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. In this case study, I used various Python packages for data analysis and visualization purposes to answer the question for an organization so that they can make a data-driven decision and they will be able to come up with a marketing strategy which to attract more customers based on my insights and recommendations.
